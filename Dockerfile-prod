#Based on the template from niployments (https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/niployments) for react applications

# First, building the static files
FROM node:10.17.0-alpine as build

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Because colors break logs
ENV NPM_CONFIG_COLOR=false

# Production or not doesn't really matter as this image will not be used other than for building
RUN npm install

# Necessary files for building the app
COPY public/ public/
COPY config/ config/
COPY scripts/ scripts/
COPY src/ src/

# Building the image
RUN npm run build

# Then, use nginx to serve the built files
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copying the built files into the nginx image, to the default served directory
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
